Welcome to our lecture repository!

In this repository, you will find presentations and code files that we will discuss during the sessions. These materials are designed to support your learning and help you explore the concepts covered in our discussions.

Important Note: This repository will be made private in a few days. Therefore, I strongly recommend downloading any files you find useful before it becomes inaccessible.

If you have any questions about the models or encounter any issues, please feel free to reach out to me via my UVA email.

Package Compatibility Notice: Please keep in mind that although these codes were recently used, software packages are frequently updated. If you experience any errors, it is most likely related to package compatibility issues. In such cases, I suggest verifying the versions of the required packages and updating or downgrading them as needed.

These codes have been tested and applied across various projects to facilitate your understanding and implementation of practical pipelines.

I hope you find this workshop insightful and enjoyable!
